# Technical Roadmap for Onboarding VeChain

NFT tracking will be implemented by reading clauses in every transaction for each block and decoding the inputs and events of the clauses.

We start with the transfer events including mints. Then we move to the sales which are usually not standardized, so we would have to parse the events and find all the transfers of the NFTs and corresponding payments that happened within the same clause. Last piece is getting the metadata for NFTs by using their tokenURI.

As soon as everything is implemented for tracking we are making a test period of live tracking to verify the accuracy, fixing the bugs if any and enabling historical crawl of the blockchain to have all the NFTs being tracked and setup on the platform.

To have the required accuracy and reliability we will have to setup a node/api or find a source to use.

| Task | Duration |
| --- | --- |
| Investigate node/api setup | 1 week |
| Parse block, transactions, clauses and events | 2 weeks |
| Track transfers | 1 week |
| Track sales | 2 weeks |
| Get NFT metadata | 1 week |
| Historical crawling | 4-6 weeks |
